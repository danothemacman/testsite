   <h2>Learning to Code</h2>
   <h4>Just an old guy learning to code and do things computerish...</h4>
   <h3>The Journey</h3>
   <p>I am not sure where this journey will take me and what adventures I might have along the way.  But that is at least half the fun of a journey isn't it?<!-- is that too trite? -->  The end is never really the end and I have learned that we are <b>always</b> learning - but the destination I have in mind (for now) is to become a competent coder, and to be able to find my way around a Linux command line.  I intend to document the trip and share what I learn along the way.</p>
   <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>I am the product of 59 years of life experience and a public education received when banging rocks together and grunting was our highest form of communication. As may be painfully obvious, I have no real experience with coding. I have wide and various interests including photography, travel, language (I speak some Chinese) and writing and now coding.  I have been involved with computers since DOS. See... I wasn't kidding about that banging rocks stuff.</p>
   <h3>What I am Interested in Learning</h3>
   <ul>
   <li>HTML</li>
   <li>Python</li>
   <li>Markdown</li>
   <li>My way around the Linux command line</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>The Tools I Will be Using</h3>
   <h4>I will review these tools in detail - from the perspective of a beginner - as we go along.</h4>
